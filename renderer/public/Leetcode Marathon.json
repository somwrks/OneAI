        "description": "The key components of the code include:\n- **`main.py`:** Contains the main logic for the project. It defines classes and functions for handling various tasks related to competitive programming, such as linked lists, sorting algorithms, etc.  \n- **`improv.txt`:**  A simple text file used for keeping a list of topics or areas for improvement. It includes topics like Back Tracking, Back Propogation, Dynamic Programming, and others. This file is useful for tracking progress and planning future learning goals. \n"

        "title": "## Overview",
        "description": "This repository contains a collection of Python solutions for LeetCode problems. The primary goal is to document my problem-solving journey for cracking FAANG interviews. Each solution represents a different problem and its efficient implementation in Python.  The `main.py` file serves as a central hub for common data structures like linked lists and utility functions used across various solutions. The `improv.txt` file lists areas of improvement and concepts I am actively learning, such as backtracking, dynamic programming, and backpropagation.  Feel free to explore the code and learn from the solutions. \n"
