        "title": "## Overview",
        "description": "The project consists of the following components:\n1. `jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv`: The dataset file containing the training data.\n2. `train.csv`: A copy of the dataset file.\n3. `main.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.\n4. `toxicity.h5`: The saved model weights after training."

        "title": "## Dependencies",
        "description": "The project requires the following dependencies:\n- NumPy\n- Pandas\n- TensorFlow\n- Keras\n- Matplotlib\n- Gradio"
      },
      {
        "title": "## Usage",
        "description": "1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.\n2. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.\n3. Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the model, evaluate its performance, and interact with the model using the Gradio interface."
